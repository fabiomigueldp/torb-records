# The ORM relationships should handle this if `PlaylistTrack.track` relationship is correctly defined in models.py
# models.py: class PlaylistTrack(Base): ... track = relationship("Track") - this looks correct.
# The from_orm method should then populate it.

# Final check on model for PlaylistDB for response for GET /api/playlists and GET /api/playlists/{id}
# The PlaylistDB model has `tracks: List[PlaylistTrackDB] = []`.
# When `PlaylistDB.from_orm(playlist_model)` is called, SQLAlchemy's lazy loading or eager loading (if configured)
# for `playlist_model.tracks` will provide the `PlaylistTrack` model instances.
# Each `PlaylistTrack` model instance, when `PlaylistTrackDB.from_orm()` is called on it (implicitly by Pydantic),
# will populate its `track` field using its own `track` relationship. This seems correct.
# The positions must be ordered correctly in the response.
# Let's add an explicit order_by for tracks in the PlaylistDB model or when querying.
# It's better to handle ordering in the query or relationship definition.

# In models.py, for Playlist.tracks relationship, add order_by:
# tracks = relationship("PlaylistTrack", back_populates="playlist", cascade="all, delete-orphan", order_by="PlaylistTrack.position")
# This will ensure that when `playlist.tracks` is accessed, it's already sorted.
# I'll make this change in `backend/torb/models.py` next.

# Also, need to include this router in main.py
# app.include_router(playlists_router.router)
# And import: from backend.routes import playlists as playlists_router

# The `get_db` dependency is assumed to be in `backend.main.py`.
# Let's verify its location. It's in `backend.routes.preferences`
# from backend.routes.preferences import get_db
# So, in this file: from backend.routes.preferences import get_db - this is correct.
# No, get_db is imported from main.py in the original code, let's stick to that.
# `from backend.main import get_db` is not right. `get_db` is defined in `preferences.py`.
# It should be `from backend.routes.preferences import get_db`. I will correct this.

# Correcting get_db import
# from backend.routes.preferences import get_db
# This is now at the top of the file.

# One final check on the `add_or_reorder_track_in_playlist` logic for position validation.
# When adding a new track, `max_pos` is `len(playlist.tracks)` *before* adding.
# So, a new track can be added at `max_pos + 1`.
# If `new_position` is `max_pos + 1`, it means adding at the end.
# The condition `1 <= new_position <= max_pos + 1` is correct for adding.
# For reordering, `max_pos` is `len(playlist.tracks)`.
# The condition `1 <= new_position <= max_pos` is correct for reordering.

# The `TrackInPlaylist` model is used to represent track details within a playlist track response.
# It should correctly serialize from `models.Track`.
# `TrackInPlaylist.duration` is optional, `models.Track.duration` is also nullable. This is fine.

# The `PlaylistTrackDB` has `track: TrackInPlaylist`. When `PlaylistTrackDB.from_orm(playlist_track_model)` is called,
# `playlist_track_model.track` (which is a `models.Track` instance) will be used to populate this field.
# Pydantic will then convert `models.Track` to `TrackInPlaylist`. This is fine.
# This relies on the relationship `PlaylistTrack.track` being correctly populated.
# If `playlist_track_model` is freshly created or fetched, its relationships might be lazy-loaded.
# Pydantic's `from_orm` should trigger these lazy loads if accessed.

# Consider the `get_playlist_or_404` helper.
# If `check_owner` is True (default):
#   If playlist not found -> 404
#   If `username` is provided (i.e., `current_user.username`):
#     If `playlist.owner != username` AND `not playlist.is_shared` -> 403
# This logic is correct for ensuring only owners or users accessing a shared playlist can proceed.
# For PUT/DELETE on playlist itself, and POST/DELETE on tracks, there's an additional explicit check:
# `if playlist.owner != current_user.username: raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, ...)`
# This is correct as only owners should modify. Shared playlist access is read-only for non-owners.

# The `get_playlists` endpoint:
# `(models.Playlist.owner == current_user.username) | (models.Playlist.is_shared == True)`
# This correctly fetches all playlists owned by the user AND all playlists marked as shared, regardless of owner.
# This fulfills the requirement: "Shared playlists should also be visible to other users (read-only)."
# The "read-only" part is enforced by the individual PUT/DELETE/POST endpoints checking ownership.
# Sorting by name is a nice touch: `.order_by(models.Playlist.name)`

# The `get_playlist` (single playlist) endpoint:
# Uses `get_playlist_or_404(playlist_id, db, current_user.username, check_owner=True)`.
# This correctly allows access if the user is the owner OR if the playlist is shared.
# If the playlist is not shared and the user is not the owner, it raises 403.

# The code seems robust for the described API endpoints.
# I will now make the modification to `models.py` for the `order_by` in the relationship.
# Then, I'll update `main.py` to include the router.
# After that, I'll consider this part of the backend implementation complete and move to tests.
# No, the plan step is "Backend Implementation", which includes tests. So I'll write tests after these file changes.
# For now, these are the core route implementations.
print("Playlist routes defined. Next: update models.py and main.py, then write tests.")
